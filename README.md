# **Project and Learning**

### A repository containing my personal projects and activities in **Python**.


## *Index*
### **1 - Even or Odd**
A program to check if the number entered by the user is **Even** or **Odd**.

### **2 - Largest Number**
A program that asks the user for two numbers and shows which one is the **largest**.

### **3 - Average Grade**
A program that asks the user for 3 grades, calculates the average of these grades and shows the result as: **Approved | Remedial | Failed**.

### **4 - Age**
A program that asks the user for their age and checks if they are **Minor, Adult, or Elderly**.

### **5 - Older Age**
A program that asks the user for two ages and shows which age is **older**. If both are equal, it prints to the screen that the ages are **equal**..

### **6 - PNZ**
A program that asks the user for a number will say that if the number is **greater** than zero, it is **positive**; if it is **less** than zero, it is **negative**; and if it is **equal** to zero, it is **equal** to zero. **PNZ = POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, ZERO**.

### **7 - Valid Triangle**
A program that asks the user for 3 sides of a triangle; if the sum of two sides is greater than the third side, the result is a **valid triangle**; otherwise, the result is an **invalid triangle**.

### **8 - Calculator**
A program that asks the user to select which mathematical operation they want to perform, being: **1. Addition | 2. Subtraction | 3. Division | 4. Multiplication**. The user selects the operation by number and enters two numbers. If the user selects an operation that is not in the list, the program returns **Invalid Operation** at the end.
